# Weather-Prediction-Using-Predictive-Modeling

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of weather events data across 49 states in the United States. The dataset comprises a staggering 8.6 million events, ranging from regular occurrences like rain and snow to extreme weather phenomena such as storms and freezing conditions. The data spans from January 2016 to December 2022 and is sourced from 2,071 airport-based weather stations nationwide.

The analysis confirmed that both Logit and Probit models are highly effective in forecasting weather conditions, showcasing a strong goodness of fit as indicated by identical deviance and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores. The calibration graph demonstrates that these models accurately predict the probabilities of various weather conditions, aligning perfectly with observed probabilities. This precise calibration across different weather types underscores the reliability of the models in practical applications.

Significant patterns and insights emerged from the data analysis, particularly in understanding the dynamics of precipitation across geographical coordinates. The seasonal analysis revealed a distinct pattern in precipitation trends, increasing in the latter half of the year, which corresponds with historical climate patterns. These findings not only validate the models' effectiveness but also enhance our capability to predict and prepare for seasonal and geographical variations in weather conditions .
